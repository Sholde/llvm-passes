* Usage

  For now, the passes are written to be passed to the ~opt~ command which is
  given by llvm. You must therefore build llvm by putting the different passes
  that are in the ~src~ directory in the ~lib/Transform/~ directory of llvm.

  NOTE: don't forget to add these directories to the ~CMakeLists.txt~ directory
  of ~lib/Transform/~.

** Example to build LLVM
*** Compilation

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ cmake --build . -j 4
    #+END_SRC

*** Installation

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ sudo cmake --build . -j 4 --target install
    #+END_SRC

** Execution of passes
*** Compile your source code

    Don't forget to compile with ~-O0~ to avoid deleting useless instructions
    during optimization passes.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ clang -O0 -emit-llvm double.c -c -o double.bc
    #+END_SRC

*** Launch of the pass with opt

    here we use the ~-enable-new-pm=0~ option to use the old pass manager.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ opt -enable-new-pm=0 -load ~/path/to/llvm/build/lib/LLVMFastFP.so -fast-fp < double.bc > /dev/null
    #+END_SRC
